# Looking into Seattle Airbnb Open Data

Here I used the data from Seattle Airbnb to get some insight to answer couple of questions as listed below. The data is downloaded from [kaggle open data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle)

## Questions
1) What are the busiest times of the year to visit seattle? by how much do prices spike?

2) Describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood

3) Is there anything about the properties that helps us predict price. For example, can we find negative and positive reviews based on the text?

## Files and folders descriptions

- Udacity_Project1.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook where I have looked at the data and for each question above I did some analysis with plots for visualisation.
- Seattle folder contains 3 csv files that are used in the code as inputs for different analysis.
    - Listings, including full descriptions, average review score, and all information regarding each listing id
    - Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
    - Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
- df_review_grouped.pkl is a dataframe which is a result of a preprocess function that works on the text values. As this function takes a long time to run each time on the whole data, I saved the out put and read in later in the code so I do not need to run the function everytime.
- results folder where the result of LDA model is saved.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@rojan.saghian/travelling-to-seattle-what-you-need-to-know-f94769265430).

## Libraries used

- numpy==1.24.3
- pandas==1.5.1
- matplotlib==3.7.1
- seaborn==0.12.2
- wordcloud=1.9.2
- PTL==9.4.0
- gensim==4.3.0
- pyLDAvis==3.4.0
- nltk==3.8.1


## Installation
The code runs with Python3 and need the libraries as listed above. 

For wordcloud to work you need to install pillow:
- `!pip install --upgrade pillow==9.5.0`

To do data preparation for LDA modelling you need to first install gensim and then import it and its depending libraries:
- `!pip install gensim`
- `from gensim.utils import simple_preprocess`
- `import gensim.corpora as corpora`

To do the LDA modelling you need to install pyLDAvis:
- `!pip install pyLDAvis`
and upgrade pyLDAvis and pandas
- `!pip install --upgrade pyLDAvis==3.4.1`
- `!pip install --upgrade pandas==1.5.1`
then import it and its dependant libraries:
- `import pyLDAvis`
- `import pyLDAvis.gensim`
- `import pyLDAvis.gensim_models as gensimvis`
- `import pickle`

To do Sentimental analysis you need to install nltk:
- `!pip install nltk`

then import it and its dependant libraries:
- `import nltk`
- `from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`
- `from nltk.corpus import stopwords`
- `from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize`
- `from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer`
